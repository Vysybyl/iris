*This text comes from many many bitter sleepless nights of roaming and obsessive thoughs that eventually materialized into an improvised 5 minutes "flash talk" during last PyCon Italia in Bologna on May '25. (You may check it out [here](https://youtu.be/vg-PhKGDjNc?si=F4WFh7aJldbUMcS1&t=2400) at minute 40:00). What follows is a rough attempt to give these thoughts order and shape.*

*I thank PyCon Italia and the PyCon community for fostering such a welcoming space, and I am deeply grateful to everyone that came to congratulate me after the talk and during the conference, showing that what I feel is a common care and not a lonely obsession. This post would not have existed without you.*

# The free chunks of awareness

Picture yourself going about with your life on an average day, not from the perspective of the actions you take, the places you visit or the people with whom you interact, but considering the time when you are aware. How much of that time can you freely spend on anything you want?

From the 24-hour day, you shoud immediately remove about 6 to 8 hours of sleep. Then, for most people, a good chunk of time when you are completelly focused on your work, say, 5 to 6 hours.
You hopefully spend at least 2 or 3 hours with your loved ones, maybe talking while having dinner or breakfast, but still not paying attention to anything else. (I am not suggesting that this time is poorly spent, I am just pointing out that it is taken). Finally, you might have to take care of some mundane tasks at work or at home, like washing your teeth or doing the laundry, that do not require your full attention but that nevertheless occupy a part of your daily "awareness space". Let's say that this takes about two hours on average.

What is left is a few free hours of awareness each day, split into chunks and spread out over the day. How much free aware time do you have? How do you use it?

# The rectangle of awareness

Now imagine you gather together all this 24-hour strips to include most, if not all, human beings on the planet. Some strips will be very different from the one described above, but a large number of them will be quite similar to it.

If you join them together, you get a *rectangle of existence*: a huge block of size 24 hours times 8,2 billion people (more or less). Inside this rectangle you will see the aware time of each human being, partly free, partly taken by work, errands, human interactions, etc. Finally, if we assume an average behaviour for every person, the *rectangle of awareness*.n

All human experience lives in this peculiar space. All interactions, emotions, thoughts, conscious actions and ideas **must** take an area of the rectangle to exist from a human point of view. There are clearly a lot of simplifications in place here and I do not want to get too technical either from the psychological or philosophycal side.

Let's focus instead on the free awareness part. First of all, every interaction with an entertainment service or media happens here: from watching a football match on the TV to reading a book. This is also true for social media: according to [this study](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/social-media-usage) the average time spent on social media is 2 hours and 24 minutes.

The untold goal of most digital media out there is to fill as much as possible of this *finite* resource - world human awareness - with some kind of digital interaction. This applies to advertisement-based companies like Google, Meta, ByteDance and X Corp., which sell parcels of human awareness in form of impressions and clicks; but the same applies to a political platform like Truth. 

About half of US adults get at least some news from social media.

And we, ICT workers, are instrumental to this process.

# Faster, more connected, more productive

> *Fitter, happier, more productive ~ Radiohead*

Communities tend to assemble around shared values. These can be explicitly declared, as it happens with religious communities, or remain unspoken. Unspoken values and believes can be nefarious as they drive people's actions standing as a placeholder for "good", but are never openly scrutinized. I think the ICT worker community is haunted by some unspoken values.

*Speed* is one of those values. We are often tasked with the goal of making our systems go faster - may them be a database, a data transmission network or a computing process. Most 4G smartphones are capable of streaming data fast enough to receive a 4K live video which, on a 7-inch display, is already more than what the human eye can distinguish. The LLM-based autocomplete tool on my IDE is constantly posting samples of my code to a remote server and downloading the response to show me suggestions that are generally discarded.
**We always want more speed, but to go where?**

*Connectedness* is another unspoken value that is blindly taken as *good by itself*. Smartphones, social networks, IoT devices, unmanned vehicles, satellite internet connections are all pieces of a picture that points towards a single perennial worldwide digital network and considers those offline places and beings as non-existant. Do we all always need to be connected with each other? Aren't there those things called *bad companies*? And, considering that this process brings large accumulations of information and power into just a few hands, should we consider how it makes humankind more easy to surveil and our consciousness more easy to pollute?

As an Italian, I heard countless times people talking about my country's cronic low productivity and I am always
But for what is the *increased productivitly*? Is automating a bomb factory line something desirable? Is maximizing the patch of the rectangle of awareness dedicated to social media? Is minimizing the earnings of gig economy workers? **If productivity is growing, why are we still working the same amount of hour per week?**

Another good example is *free software*. I have been a Linux user and advocate for about ten years now, and I am very grateful that free and open software exists. But, is is always a good thing? For instance: is GIT used in weapon production? Do Linux servers host websites that spread disinformation? Most definetively yes! Was that part of their original creators' intention? Is there anything, even a small licence clause, preventing this kind of usages?

# The knights of capitalism

Here we are: a community soaked in technical knowledge, enthusiastic for technological transformations and fostering strong work ethics. Such community seldom reflects on the final psychological, social and environmental effects of its actions *as a community*, and it is almost never in the position to take decisions.

I like to picture TIC professionals (engineers, data scientists, product managers, etc.) as the *knights of capitalism*. Just like knights in a middle age army, we are the main force needed to produce a significant effect; we are also equally expensive (check out how much a war horse and armor costed in the XIV century). Knights had chivalry as a cultural code-of-conduct to guide their actions, we follow moder world work ethics and Agile/Scrum.

Unlike those soldiers,
