# Introduction

For the ones who will understand it, what follows is a manual to reject indefinitely any claim of scientifically understanding and reproducing consciousness in the broadest meaning of the term.

The schema presented below and the text that accompanies it are not to be intended as definitive and complete, but rather as a blueprint to build against any arguments for the full scientific understanding and engineering of consciousness.

Similarly, under no circumstances this four-item list must be considered as complete: in fact, it must be understood that my aim is not to talk about consciousness *per se*, but rather to show in the most general way how the universal forms of the dialogue around consciousness - according to the scientific literature, to our current culture upon which such literature is built, and hopefully according to the reader's own understanding of the term - are mutually incompatible. I call these forms "constructs". 

This document has existed as a draft since at least February 2025, but reached it current form only recently and I will continue to update and refine it based on.

This text is probably of no use to people who do not somehow agree with at least one of the four constructs of consciousness described below, but I challenge any alternative understanding of the term "consciousness" to be socially relevant and scientifically useful. If any alternative construct spreads, one will have to show that either it can be reduced to one or more among those listed here, or that it is incompatible with science and society, for the so-called *hard problem* of consciousness has no solution in the realm of modern science, yet it is the only problem of consciousness of universal interest for humanity. 

If time shall not be merciful, I will leave such task to the good will and sharp intellect of future philosophers.

# Philosophical Framing

I leave here a few statements to help those readers aware of the history of philosophy to more easily understand what follows. These statements can be ignored.
 - "Consciousness" is used differently in different language games, which follow incompatible rules.
 - Consciousness is trascendental.
 - No claim on "hard" consciousness is falsifiable.

# The Four Constructs of Consciousness

## 1. Self Consciousness
This is the only consciousness I (or rather you) experience. It is the feeling that the stream of sensations is experienced by one single being. It is the experience that something is happening. It is the experience of time (something is happening now that is not happening before) and space (something is happening here and not there). It is the habit of recognizing "my" thoughts. It is the meaning of the word "consciousness" that I do not need to define and that I cannot doubt or confutate.

## 2. Metaphysical Consciousness
By "metaphysical consciousness" I mean the faculty of agentic self-awareness which is assumed or believed to be shared among two or more beings. Many usages of "soul" or "psyche" are part of this construction, but I prefer to use a more generic term. Here the adjective "metaphysical" must in no way be intended as "beyond the physical reality"; the term indicates instead a common trait of the usual statements from theology or metaphysics like "every human being has a consciousness" or "animals are conscious". The metaphysical consciousness is an irreducible faculty and it is either surrounded by mistery or silently assumed: when questioned directly, it presents itself as an unfalsifiable belief, often linked to a religion; in latent form, it displays itself as the underlying assumption to our common behaviour that another being can share the same faculty as my self consiousness: I do not "verify" that a person has a consciousness when I talk to them.  In communication, I can only understand and be understood by another conscious being.
Although I am not aware of any example of it, it is nevertheless possible to define a metaphysical consciousness that does not share any trait with my self consciousness: "everyone else is conscious but me". Maybe such notion is present in some psychotics.
One caveat must be added with respect to a specific form of metaphysical consciousness, panpsychism, that is the believe that everything has a consciousness.

## 3. Turing Consciousness
This construct is well-represented by the Turing test, but it has a more encompassing meaning.
A machine (that is, a human artifact) passes the Turing test if it can convince (or "fool", if you prefer) enough people that it has a consciousness. The test implies that one can interact with beings that are not conscious and that "having a consciousness" is short for being able to "communicate correctly", "use properly a communication code", "play correctly the communication game", "mimic beings that are assumed to be conscious". One must note that - typically - human beings are not Turing-tested and simply get a "free-pass" for Turing consciousness, but even the simple act of calling and slapping somebody who has fainted to wake them up can be framed as a test for Turing consciousness.
Turing consciousness is the social and relational construct of consciousness: a being is turing-conscious if it can convince other conscious being that it is conscious. Hence, it is obvious that Turing consciousness is ill-defined, as it derives from other consciousnesses, and therefore cannot be used as a ground definition of consciousness; it is nevertheless useful here to cover under a single form all those cases where the presence of consciousness is determined via some kind of communication test, regardless of how refined and engineered the test is.

## 4. Machine Consciousness
This construct entails that consciousness is a physical process that can, at least theoretically, be reproduced. The typical example of this construct states that the consciousness is one of the activities (or the activity) of the human brain or central nervous system - considered as a machine - and that therefore a proper system capable of simulating such activity MUST be conscious (by definition). This is obviously the most appealing construct from an engineering or medical perspective.

[I believe these four constructs to be wide enough to include all most common and significant usages of the word "consciousness". If you are not convinced, please let me know what you think is missing. ]

# The Aporiai of Consciousness

I now describe how the four constructs relate to one another. In some cases they are partially compatible. In others they are mutually exclusive.

## Self Consciousness vs. Metaphysical Consciousness

Self consciousness and metaphysical consciousness are not uncompatible. The statement "all human beings share the same fundamental experience of being conscious as I do" is not contraddictory but, as stated above, it is unfalsifiable. From a political point of view, one may be compelled or persuaded that another being is conscious, and many demands formulated by civil right or animal right movements assume some metaphysical statements on consciousness.

From an experiential perspective, one may **feel** that metaphysical consciousness inhabits self consciousness in form of empathy (or compassion). But one can always refuse to accept such statements: "your experience of the world is similar to mine", "I understand my dog", "that bird is in pain", etc.

All aporiai related to qualia fall within this perspective (in fact, talking about self consciousness brings it immediately into the realm of metaphysical consciousness), but the self consciousness/metaphysical consciousness polarization is more encompassing than the debate on qualia, as it includes consciousness without any object.

## Self vs. Turing Consciousness 

As defined above, Turing consciousness can never be experienced in the first person and, for this reason, is incompatible with self consciousness.

To be more specific, one may assume that Turing consciousness is always granted to self consciousness; or, one may equally say that when I interact with another being as if they were conscious, I (that is, my self consciousness) am granting Turing consciousness to them. 

Rather than logically incompatible, self consciousness and Turing consciousness are therefore useless together, because the second one can only be founded on the first one, thus losing its value as a test or an independent definition.

With respect to self consciousness, Turing consciousness is almost a qualium.

## Self vs. Machine Consciousness

A machine is always an object and therefore it can never be experienced as self consciousness, that is, as the subject of the experience. 

Let us accept the mechanicist thesis that consciousness is a form of brain activity and let us imagine that all activity in my brain is mapped and mirrored exactly by a powerful simulator. By observing the simulator, I could see the activity corresponding in my brain to myself observing the simulator, almost like a mirror reflecting another mirror. For instance, I could see some beams of light representing neural impulses travelling through the eye nerves to the cortex, or some computer logs on a screen, etc. Whatever stimulus I receive from the simulator to my senses, it would always look as a thing, a machine, highly correlated with my self consciousness but always distinct from it, in a similar way as watching an ECG trace doesn't "explain" nor "exaust" the experience of having a beating heart, but at most enriches and echoes it.

The imaginary scenario where my entire brain is swapped with a machine does not make self and machine consciousness compatible either: from a self conscious perspective, I could not tell for sure if my experience of the world had changed after the swap, since all references to the original (brain) self consciousness would rely on the new hardware; from a machine conscious point of view, the people who made the swap could only observe correlations between my present and past behaviour. They could not tell apart wether I changed my mind or my mind was changed.

## Metaphysical vs. Turing Consciousness

Metaphysical consciousness is incompatible with Turing consciousness in the sense that one is a belief and the other is the result of a consensus process.
Imagine, for instance, a society were only men are believed to be conscious (metaphysical statement). One day, a woman passes the Turing test, and she consistently passes it before any set of men that tests her. What will happen afterwards? A belief change? A schism? Will the test be dismissed as mockery? It is clearly impossible to answer these questions *a priori*: with respect to metaphysical believes on consciousness, a Turing test is nothing but a rethorical device. On the other end, if a communicating community acts as if one of its member is conscious, that member will be Turing conscious even if the community's declared believes state otherwise.

## Metaphysical vs. Machine Consciousness

These constructs are partially compatible: it should be clear by now that, in fact, machine consciousness is just a specific case of metaphysical consciousness. Hence, if one accepts the premise that consciousness is an activity of the brain, it follows immediately that all beings with that activity must be conscious, irrespectively to how they relate or communicate with each others (including myself). On the other end, there exist infinite metaphysical statements (or believes) on consciousness that are not compatible with machine consciousness.
