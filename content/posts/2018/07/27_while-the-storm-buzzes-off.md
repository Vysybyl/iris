*While the storm buzzes off down the street*  
*And the other chimps' yackety-yak grows back*  
*'Bout what that monkey did do the other monkeys said to see*  
*I'm flashed by all those pieces of heart collected around the sphere*  
*Faithful sad young faces nodding their beliefs to the last steps of the dark dance ending upon us all*  
*And I wonder if sparkles those are not of dying hopes*  
*But the subtle omens of things getting prepared to soon be seen*  
*For I know you are with me*
