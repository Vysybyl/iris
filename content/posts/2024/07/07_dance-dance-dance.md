*Yeah, sure, I'll trust this whole mess*  
*And then what?*  

*I'll stomp my feet onto the naked stone*  
*I'll skip over the unthrustable plants with thorns*  
*I'll be me, be myself, be authentic to the bone*  
*And then what?*  

*I'll dance my family tree off*  
*I'll shake down my skin to my ankles*  
*I'll say a few German words*  
*And then what?*  

*I'll buy TupperwareÂ®*  
*hop books on Physics*  
*I'll save some space by doing so*  
*And then what?*  

*I'll crawl back through the beginning*  
*to the first seed*  
*I'll be stone again*  
*again plant, fish, man-kind*  
*Saturn, pudding and weed*  
*I trust I can dance*  
*the first and the last words*  
*And then what?*
